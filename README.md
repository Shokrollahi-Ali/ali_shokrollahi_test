# ali_shokrollahi_test

## Overview

This React project was created to address specific tasks outlined in a given set of questions. The primary focus of this project is to implement functionality while keeping the user interface (UI) simple and minimal.

## Project Structure

**Absolute vs Relative Imports:** Although I generally prefer absolute imports for their convenience, this project utilizes relative imports. This decision was made for time efficiency. In a real-world scenario, I would typically use absolute imports for better organization and scalability.

## Implemented Features

You can check the result of the cache function in the console log.

## Limitations

- **Input Validation:** Validation for inputs, especially for Task A, is not robust. For instance, there is no validation to ensure that the second input is larger or equal to the first input.

- **UI Styling:** The project's UI is minimal, focusing on functionality rather than aesthetics. No styling has been applied to the components.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
